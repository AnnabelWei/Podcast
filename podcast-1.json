{"text": " Today, we're going to be talking about if books really help with marketing. You see companies all the time releasing books to help them generate more sales, but do they really help? Now Eric, you have a book. I have a book as well. You're a bestselling author, right? And I was also a bestselling author. You're a New York Times bestselling author. Yeah, that's all the same stuff. And I found that a book didn't help me generate more revenue, didn't help much with marketing. Did you find it helping you with much? No, and I'll tell you what, I think we both have really interesting stories here. So you want to go on yours first? So Neil's book was called Limitless? Hustle. Hustle. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Okay, so the book was Hustle. We sold a lot of copies to corporations, sold a lot of copies in general, hit the New York Times list, I think three weeks in a row. I could be wrong, but I think it was three weeks in a row. And what we found is it didn't do much for us. I think there's a few issues that I learned when it comes to books and marketing. One, hustle is a broad topic. It's not related enough to marketing. So it didn't help from that aspect. Two, I had co-authors, nothing wrong with my co-authors, but if I published the book and it was just me, I think it would have done better. Three, unless your book could be on something really, really mainstream, I don't think it's going to, like Tim Ferriss for our work week, I don't think it's going to help that much. And four, if you create an industry-related book, it can help with marketing, but you got to spend a lot of money promoting it and look at your book as a loss leader, not a money generator. And you have to look at your back end as the money generator. Yeah. So interestingly enough, I have a book. So we're recording live right now. I'm going to actually pull the book into the screen. So give me one second as I pull it up. All right. What's the book called? YouTube Formula. All right. So the book that he has, because you probably can't hear him on the microphone, is YouTube Formula and is by Daryl Eves. So Daryl Eves. All right. What do you want to talk about with the book? So this guy, he has worked very closely with Jimmy. So MrBeast, he's worked very closely with the top YouTube creators out there. And this guy's literally, his business is like YouTube coaching basically. And he like has a lot of equity in other YouTube channels. And so he knows what he's talking about here. And so I was picking it up and I was reading it. I was like, oh, there's some good stuff in here. And so I was looking at Amazon and this book has, sure, it's a 4.7, 826 reviews and all that. And it's decently ranked. I'm trying to look at the rank for it right now. So it is ranked. It's too hard for me to pull up right now. But point is, do I think this helped this guy's business? Yes. But do I think it's like a massively transformative thing? No, not. Dude, the problem with writing a book is a lot of the information, depending on the industry here and gets outdated the moment the book is published. That's the bad part. And I found that the people have done best from books that are businesses that release them. They use a book as a promotion method and they spend an arm and a leg promoting it, getting into a lot of hands. They lose money on the book, even though they're getting massive advances and they're making money on the back end. That's the key I've seen most people do. Remember the growth hacking book that Sean Ellis and I think it's Morgan Brown did? Yeah. So they got like a big advance for it. But then I think afterwards, I'm not sure if the book got the result that they wanted. Sean, you did well before the book. Yeah. Oh, so this actually this book does well right now. So this book's been around for a while. I actually have two copies of it. And so this is ranked number 1579 in all books on Amazon. That's actually really high. What ranked 279? 1579 in all books. That's high. Yeah. And then number one in computer hacking, which is like a BS category, number three in e-commerce professional and number four in web marketing. So this is actually a high performing book and this was published. It's a first edition. So I think if you are going to publish a book, like if we publish on a marketing, we would be publishing editions because marketing changes so quickly. Yeah. Now, let me talk about my experience. 2021, this book was published 2021. So I published a book that's completely unrelated to marketing. Same as Neil. Both ours was like in the personal growth space. Right. Yeah. And mine was how I just see life as a game. Neil's was on hustling. So it's kind of similar. Right. And I wrote, it took me like six years to write it because I was writing it on and off. And if you're going to write a book, it's a labor of love. Yeah. And do I, it definitely would you do it again? We got a special message from our sponsor. If you want to rank higher on Google, you got to look at your page speed time, the faster your website loads, the better off you are with Google's core vital update. That makes it super, super important to optimize your site for low time. And one easy way to do it is use the host that Eric and I use dream hosts. So just go to dream host or Google it, find it, check it out. And it's a great way to improve your load time. No, I say this, say, everyone's like, Hey, do you want to write a book? We can help you with them. Like, it's OK. I would, if I would write another book, if it was in marketing and because, I mean, you get hit up on all the time, like Wiley hits me up. Sure. Right. Like I would do it on marketing because it would help our businesses. Right. But dude, even I do, I don't think I would do it right now. It's too much work for the ROI. Like, yeah, I get hit up at least twice a year for a company to write a book on marketing and the range in advances for people willing to pay like a half a million bucks to maybe seven, 800. Yeah. Last book, I got a half a million, although there was co-authors that we split the money and it's just not worth it. It's a lot of work for the money. You know, we talked about like the relationship platform versus like, sure, the book is a relationship platform and you do kind of get to know someone. So I think if you're going to write like a biography, cool. Do it like later in your life. Maybe. Like that would be cool. Right. I'm looking at the Hermosys right now. I'm looking at Alex. So he has 16,000 reviews on a hundred million dollar offers, 4.9 stars. And I think he said he sold like three or 400,000 copies, which is amazing. That's a lot. Good for him. It's a lot. And now he has his hundred million leads coming out. Now, do I think this is going to help with his deal flow? What do you think? I think he already gets enough deal flow. The issue is the right type of deal flow. Yeah. So, I mean, I think it certainly helps with his brand. Yes. And I do think in the long run, it'll help with deal flow, but I love writing too. Yeah. He loves creating content. Yep. But I think there's better ways to generate leads and this isn't to pick on Alex. I bet he would agree with this as well. I think there's better ways to generate leads than writing a book. Yeah, I agree. And it's a lot. So here's the thing though, we both have leverage in our own respective rights. Like this podcast is leverage, right? Yeah. So you would just pull the lever a little more and it's like, you get a lot more from it. It's like, you know what I mean? So I don't know, man. I will probably won't write a book for like at least the next five years. We'll just put it that way. You're probably out. I won't write a book again. I don't think I'll write a book. Yeah. What if you wrote it yourself fully? I still won't write a book again. All right. Well, that's fair. Oh, you know what you could do? Before we go, you could do what Mark Cuban did and Ben Horowitz did. You know what they did? No, they just took all their blog posts and just combine it into a book. And the books crushed it. I could do that, but I don't want to do that either because marketing, a lot of it's old and outdated, so I would have to keep publishing additions as you mentioned. And I don't want to go through that. I can do an edition every year. Anyway, that's an idea for you guys to do out there. We're probably not going to do it. So that is it for today. Please don't forget to rate, review, subscribe five stars, please.
